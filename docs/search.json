    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nThe current study analyzes the suitability and reliability of selected neurophysiological and vegetative nervous system markers as biomarkers for exercise and recovery in endurance sport. Sixty-two healthy men and women, endurance trained and moderately trained, performed two identical acute endurance tests (running trial 1 and running trial 2) followed by a washout period of four weeks. Exercise protocol consisted of an acute running trial lasting 60 minutes. An intensity corresponding to 95% of the heart rate at individual anaerobic threshold for 40 minutes was followed by 20 minutes at 110%. At pre-exercise, post-exercise, three hours post-exercise and 24 hours post-exercise, experimental diagnostics on Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), heart rate variability (HRV), Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT), and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) were performed. Significant changes over time were found for all parameters (p &lt; .05). Furthermore, there was an approached statistical significance in the interaction between gender and training status in BDNF regulation (F(3) = 2.43; p = 0.06), while gender differences were found only for LF/HF-ratio (3hPoEx, F(3) = 3.40; p = 0.002). Regarding the reliability, poor ICC-values (&lt; 0.5) were found for BDNF, Stroop sensitivity and pNN50, while all other parameters showed moderate ICC-values (0.5-0.75). Plasma-BDNF, SCWT performance, pain perception and all HRV parameters are suitable exercise-sensitive markers after an acute endurance exercise. Moreover, pain perception, SCWT reaction time and all HRV parameters show a moderate reliability, others rather poor. In summary, a selected neurophysiological and vegetative marker panel can be used to determine exercise load and recovery in endurance sports, but its repeatability is limited due to its vaguely reliability."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nElite athletes are high-performance outliers within their specific sports. Even though science seeks to understand the nature of expertise and elite performance, much knowledge remains compartmentalized within subdisciplines. Despite this multidimensionality being acknowledged, an interdisciplinary approach to understanding elite athletes is still rare. This paper synthesizes insights across scientific domains in order to describe the population and individual characteristics of elite athletes. We analyzed diagnostic data from approximately 300 German squad athletes across eight different sports (e.g., gymnastics, volleyball, ice hockey, 3 × 3 basketball etc., agefemale = 18.95 ± 4.84 years, agemale = 19.32 ± 4.19 years) with expertise values ranging from 2 (low expertise) to 16 (high expertise). Data covered muscular strength, lower-body dynamics, muscle-power genetics, blood micronutrients, basic cognitive function, mental health, social support, and training conditions. Results of logistic regressions identified basic cognitive function (B = 0.89) and well-balanced blood micronutrients (B = 1.22) as critical factors distinguishing elite athletes. Additionally, multiple linear regressions suggested that lower-body dynamics (ß = 0.72) is related to increasing expertise values. We examined interactions between determinants of elite performance, and found that social support is positively associated with mental health and training conditions, whereas muscular strength correlates with lower-body dynamics. Focusing on top elite athletes in contrast to semi-elite athletes, we found higher within-group similarities in basic cognitive function and blood micronutrients. Findings indicate the need for a systemic, individualized, and comprehensive model using individual-based profiles."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nThe high interindividual variability of exercise response complicates the efficient use of blood-based biomarkers in sports. To address this problem, a useful algorithm to characterize the individual regulation and predictive value of diferent candidate markers will be developed. Forty-nine participants completed two identical exercise trials. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after, 3 hours after, and 24 hours after completion of exercise. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL-) 1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, creatine kinase (CK), cortisol, c-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured. Individualized regulation was analyzed using k-means clustering and a Group Assignment Quality (GAQ) score. Regression trees with a bootstrapped-aggregated approach were used to assess the predictive qualities of the markers. For most of the markers studied, a distinction can be made between individuals who show a stronger or weaker response to a particular endurance training program. The regulation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and CK exhibited a high degree of stability within the individuals. Regarding the predictive power of the markers, for all dependent variables, the most accurate predictions were obtained for cortisol and IL-8 based on the baseline value. For CK, a good prediction of recovery of maximal strength and subjective feeling of exhaustion can be made. For IL-1RA and TBARS, especially their reregulation can be predicted if the baseline level is known. Focusing individual variations in biomarker responses, our results suggest the combined use of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and CK for the personalized management of stress and recovery cycles following endurance exercise."

This study aimed to expose the dose–response relationships by investigating the influence of exercise duration on subjective and objective arousal, cognitive attention and visual recognition memory tasks. Nineteen participants (eight female; 25.69 ± 3.11 years) were included in a randomized, three-armed intervention study in a cross-over design. The participants completed three different interventions consisting of either 15, 30 or 45 min of cycling at 60–70% VO2max. Arousal and cognitive measurements were taken before and immediately after (&lt;2 min) exercise. All three interventions led to significant but comparable effects on self-perceived arousal, heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant effects of exercise duration on visual recognition memory accuracy. Reaction times for higher and lower cognitive tasks did not change after exercise. Fifteen minutes of aerobic exercise was feasible to induce beneficial changes in self-perceived arousal. Processing speed of visual recognition memory and attention remained unaltered. Exercise exceeding fifteen minutes seemed to negatively impact visual recognition memory accuracy."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nThe role of power performance in elite athletes has been enriched by identifying associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and power performance. To deepen our understanding of this association, the objective of this study was to explore the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype in elite athletes. A total of 278 German national squad athletes (156 males, 122 females) underwent genotyping, and their performance in a countermovement jump test (CMJ) and 10-m sprint was assessed. Genotype distribution was analyzed using Chi-square tests. Spearman correlation was employed to examine associations between selected SNPs (e.g., ACTN3, AGT, HSD17B14, IP6K3, MTRR, UCP2, and VDR) and CMJ and sprint performances. Gender-specific polygenic “Total Genotype Scores” (TGSsig) were calculated. Predictive power of TGSsig on power performance was evaluated using linear regression. TGSsig explained 10% of variance in CMJ and sprint performance in both genders. Among males, correlations were identified between AGT and VDR with the CMJ as well as between IP6K3 and sprint performance (p &lt; 0.05). In females, ACTN3, AGT, and UCP2 exhibited associations with the CMJ, while HSD17B14, MTRR, and UCP2 were correlated with sprint performance (p &lt; 0.05). Significant differences in genotype distribution between genders were observed for DMD and MPRIP. Our findings strengthen the idea of power being partly heritable, however, the genotype only partially, by 10%, determines power performance. The role of the athletes’ genotype for individual performance development should be investigated in future longitudinal studies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nThis study aimed to compare the acute inflammatory response following high-intensity eccentric exercise between resistance-trained young and master athletes with similar performance levels. Resistance-trained young (n=8; 22±2 years) and master (n=8; 52±4 years) male athletes of a similar performance level performed a standardized high-intensity eccentric squat exercise protocol (10 sets of half-squats at 70% of 1-repetition maximum). The serum concentration of 20 biomarkers related to tissue damage, inflammation, remodeling, and repair was measured at baseline, immediately after exercise, and over a 72 h recovery period. Both groups experienced similar muscle damage as evidenced by a comparable increase in creatine kinase activity 24 h after exercise (p&lt;0.001). Interleukin-6 (p=0.009) and growth hormone (p&lt;0.001) increased immediately post-exercise in both groups. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 increased immediately post-exercise only in young athletes (p=0.003) and then decreased 24 h later. There were no significant differences for the remaining variables, including cell markers related to neutrophil/macrophage activation or pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Resistance-trained young and master athletes, matched for performance level, showed an overall similar inflammatory response to eccentric exercise, possibly reflecting regulatory mechanisms or immunological adaptations to chronic stimulation in master athletes."

    "title": "Inflammation and Cognitive Performance in Elite Athletes: A cross-sectional Study",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nFunctional cognition is relevant for athletic success and interdependent with physical exercise, yet despite repeatedly demonstrated inflammatory responses to physical training, there are no studies addressing the relationship between cognition and inflammation in athletes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cognitive performance and selected inflammatory, and further physiological biomarkers in elite athletes. Data from 350 elite athletes regarding cognitive performance (processing speed, selective attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility), systemic inflammatory markers, metabolic hormones, growth factors, tissue damage markers, and micronutrients (e.g., ferritin, 25-OH-vitamin D), as well as physiological, subjective ratings of recovery and stress were analysed by correlative and multiple regression analyses. Results show that across all athletes variance in processing speed, selective attention, and working memory, could be best explained through a combination of metabolic hormones with physiological and psychological indicators of stress, and in cognitive flexibility through vitamin D levels. Only for the subgroup of athletes from closed-skill sports, the ratio TNF-α:IL-10 significantly contributed to explanation of variance in working memory and cognitive flexibility. In general, found correlations point to the importance of inflammatory balance and sufficient long-term nutrient supply for unaffected cognitive performance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate blood-based biomarkers and their regulation with regard to different recovery-stress states. A total of 35 male elite athletes (13 badminton, 22 soccer players) were recruited, and two venous blood samples were taken: one in a ‘recovered’ state (REC) after a minimum of one-day rest from exercise and another one in a ‘non-recovered’ state (NOR) after a habitual loading microcycle. Overall, 23 blood-based biomarkers of different physiologic domains, which address inflammation, muscle damage, and tissue repair, were analyzed by Luminex assays. Across all athletes, only creatine kinase (CK), interleukin (IL-) 6, and IL-17A showed higher concentrations at NOR compared to REC time points. In badminton players, higher levels of CK and IL-17A at NOR were found. In contrast, a higher value for S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) at REC was found in badminton players. Similar differences were found for BDNF in soccer players. Soccer players also showed increased levels of CK, and IL-6 at NOR compared to REC state. Several molecular markers were shown to be responsive to differing recoverystress states, but their suitability as biomarkers in training must be further validated."
