hi and welcome to my homepage! ðŸ‘‹

my name is sebastian and i'm a doctoral student at the department of <br> exercise physiology and sports therapy \| justus liebig university giessen \| germany

my research interests include:

-   blood-based biomarkers for the monitoring of recovery-stress responses in athletes
-   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their contribution to exercise performance
-   data-driven analysis and machine learning methods for sports science (*a work in progress, but you got to start somewhere* ðŸ¤“)
